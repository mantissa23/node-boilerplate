# node-boilerplate

## Why

The boilerplates I've used to use for my projects are constantly becoming
outdated or they are simply too opinionated.

By creating this one, I'm trying to solve this problem for myself,
but feel free to use it in your own projects.

## Docker

To run services, use:

```sh
docker-compose up
```

Application will be accessible on a port `8000`.
